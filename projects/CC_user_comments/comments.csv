5,1,"Been using this in Birmingham for the past few weeks as a pay monthly Whim Everyday user. Been really happy with the app and service so far, from the initial customer representative I spoke to on the street to using the app and travel card on a daily basis. Highly recommended, looking forward to the bikes hitting town!","[everyday, user]",12/5/2018,Matthew Ellard

5,3,"Love it! Saved me multiple times when I used to forget my bus card at home, and when there was no card loading place nearby. Now it completely replaced my bus card and it feels great - no more worries that I might forget the bus card at home, lose it, or it might have expired. It has also completely replaced Google Maps for me. Looking forward for new features","[Replaced, google, maps]",14/11/2017,Iulia Adomnitsa
