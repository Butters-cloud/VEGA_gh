1,3,0,it uses a lot of battery power. Battery dies really quickly.,drains101 battery101,23/11/2018,mary_white,

3,5,1,Useful and great price value with the Urban subscription. I use it daily when I commute and occasionally for 10e taxi rides in Helsinki and city bike rides in the summer.,daily103 use103,12/2/2019,Tom Ahola,
4,5,1,"Been using this in Birmingham for the past few weeks as a pay monthly Whim Everyday user. Been really happy with the app and service so far, from the initial customer representative I spoke to on the street to using the app and travel card on a daily basis. Highly recommended, looking forward to the bikes hitting town!",everyday104 user104,12/5/2018,Matthew Ellard,

6,5,3,"Love it! Saved me multiple times when I used to forget my bus card at home, and when there was no card loading place nearby. Now it completely replaced my bus card and it feels great - no more worries that I might forget the bus card at home, lose it, or it might have expired. It has also completely replaced Google Maps for me. Looking forward for new features",Replaced106 google106 maps106,14/11/2017,Iulia Adomnitsa,
7,5,1,one of the best way to buy public transport tickets,buy107 public107 transport107,3/4/2019,Dheeraj Narang,
8,5,1,Excellent app for public transport in and around Helsinki. Also great for short taxi trips.,short108 taxi108 trips108,7/5/2019,Hemant Tiwari,
9,5,0,"This app gives multiple option what transportation to use city area, public transport, taxi, scooters, bike, car rent. This is faster way buy HSL tickets (Helsinki, Finland) than use HSL Mobiili. First purchase takes time, after payment needs wait that tickets shows. Next purchases are instant. Notice that when step vehicle / ticket area, driver wants see valid ticket or worst ticket inspector. So you must have valid ticket when enter ticket area.",multiple109 options109,20/11/2021,Mika Pirhonen,

11,1,5,"I bought a ticket before the bus arrived, and when I re-opened the app to use it, it wasn't there. I had to buy another after riding the bus and the driver was visibly upset. I contacted support and they said that the first transaction was unsuccessful so I want charged, but my bank statement clearly showed both transactions. I sent the statement to support and they said they'd issue a refund, but I never received it (neither in my bank account nor in the app credit).",ticket111 wasn't111 there111,31/10/2020,Filly,
12,3,3,Purchase is renewed automatically (and there is no way to change it in app??) and no reminder is provided before the purchase. So if you do not have money in your bank account or you have already bought a ticket in a travelling card you may have a problem..,renewed112 automatically112,14/11/2019,Jari V,
13,4,7,Useful and cheap alternative. The missing star would mean. - Unlimited offering 30-day ticket instead of separate ones. - Possibility to alter rentals without canceling them... - ...and the app communicating in real time with the service providers so that canceled rental days would appear in the quota without contacting the Whim support. - Seeing in advance which locations offer weekend cars. - More taxis and functional tracking on all taxis. + Support response time is very good if not great.,useful113 cheap113,28/10/2019,Antti Eemeli,
14,4,1,"Whim (and Uber) are the only apps you want to use if you're traveling by taxi in Helsinki area. Here's a tip that's going to save you a lot of money: Don't order a taxi by phone. Don't just enter a random ""taxi"". Buy the trip with Whim! Trust me.",traveling114 Helsinki114 area114,24/10/2020,Rasmus Rajasalo,
15,1,6,"I got automatically renewed subscribtion I wanted to cancel on the same day (didn't remember it got automatically renewed until my bank notified about a charge on my account). Apparently not possible to cancel or even postpone my subscription, even if you can't use public transportation because of Corona. New notes: Contacted customer service before leaving a review, and contacted them again after getting a reply in here and still wasn't possible to do anything.",wanted115 to115 cancel115,1/4/2020,Laura H,
16,5,3,"Some great software design here. Positioning applied only when app is active saving battery, done without delay saving time. Map view with nearest bus, bike, car stops with relevant info like which buses to arrive with est. time. Calendar sync. Lightweight, fast, even on older phones and OS including A6. The ticket app from the transport provider Whim caters for reset my mobile connection twice, taking minutes until able to provide proof of purchase. Whim takes seconds. Never looked back.",software116 design116,15/08/2019,ars at PSN,
17,1,1,"Still slow, is now more expensive than HSL, and everything has been watered down, like taxis. Guess they ran out of VC money and realised it wasn't sustainable.",expensive117,8/7/2021,Christian Nikkanen,
18,1,9,It was nightmare to use this app. They detected money on my every bike ride while they told it's free and there was no information of detection while using the app. I came to know about those transcation through my bank statement. They have credit card detials by which they were detecting money without even informing customers. I think its an scam,nightmare118,13/09/2019,Shubham Bhardwaj,
19,1,3,"I dont recommend this app. It takes too long to get a ticket. You can get fine 80 euros, and the trafic controllers can not verify you have a ticket, plus their customer service is very poor",takes119 long119,2/9/2019,Fernanda Mantilla,
20,2,1,"Pretty useless in Antwerp. There is no support for Cloud Bike, Poppy or Bird. Buying train tickets is still a pain in the ass and it's overall just expensive.",useless120,8/11/2018,Senne Marquenie,
21,2,2,"Very unreliable. Ordered taxis not showing up, bus tickets being charged twice, and the support is nonexistent: apparently any issue you have with the app is your own fault, go read instructions.",very121 unreliable121,15/12/2018,Jaana Moilanen,
22,1,4,"I needed to buy one single ticket, a finger slip and I buy a day ticket. I end up paying 11e instead of 2.8e. I contacted customer service straight away but no answer. So I am deleting the app, and going back to old fashioned way- at least this way I dont lose money for nothing!",lose122 money122,7/7/2020,Walid O. El Cheikh,
