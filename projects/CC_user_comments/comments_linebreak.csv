8,8,5,1,Excellent app for public transport in and around Helsinki. Also great for$short taxi trips.,excellent108,7/5/2019,Hemant Tiwari,#E64831
9,9,5,0,"This app gives multiple option what transportation to use city area, public$transport, taxi, scooters, bike, car rent. This is faster way buy$HSL tickets (Helsinki, Finland) than use HSL Mobiili. First purchase$takes time, after payment needs wait that tickets shows. Next purchases$are instant. Notice that when step vehicle / ticket area, driver wants$see valid ticket or worst ticket inspector.

12,12,3,3,Purchase is renewed automatically (and there is no way to change it in$app??) and no reminder is provided before the purchase.

13,13,4,7,Useful and cheap alternative. The missing star would mean. - Unlimited$offering 30-day ticket instead of separate ones. - Possibility to alter$rentals without canceling them... - ...and the app communicating in$real time with the service providers so that canceled rental days would$appear in the quota without contacting the Whim support. - Seeing in$advance which locations offer weekend cars. - More taxis and functional$tracking on all taxis. + Support response time is very good if not$great.,cheap113,28/10/2019,Antti Eemeli,#473C2B

17,17,1,1,"Still slow, is now more expensive than HSL, and everything has been watered$down, like taxis. Guess they ran out of VC money and realised it$wasn't sustainable.",expensive117,8/7/2021,Christian Nikkanen,#B5A936
18,18,1,9,It was nightmare to use this app. They detected money on my every bike$ride while they told it's free and there was no information of detection$while using the app. I came to know about those transcation through$my bank statement. They have credit card detials by which they were detecting$money without even informing customers. I think its an scam,nightmare118,13/09/2019,Shubham Bhardwaj,#ED5196
